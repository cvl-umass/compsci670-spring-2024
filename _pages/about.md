This graduate-level course will explore techniques for the analysis of
visual data, primarily color images. The first part of the course will
examine the physics and geometry of image formation, including the
design of cameras and the study of color sensing in the human eye. The
second part of the the course we will focus on algorithms to extract
information from images. This includes detection of interest points
for image alignment, depth estimation, and instance recognition;
representations and architectures of image classification, object
detection and segmentation; and generative modeling of images. The
course covers both modern (e.g., learning based) and classical
(e.g., physics and geometry based) techniques. We will also look
at some additional topics at the end of the course. Take a look at the
[lectures](lectures/) for details.

Course assignments will highlight several computer vision tasks and
methods. For each homework, you will construct a basic system and
improve it through a cycle of error analysis and model redesign. There
will also be a final project which will investigate a single topic or
application in greater depth. This course assumes a strong working
knowledge of probability, linear algebra, and ability to program in
Python. Prior experience in machine learning, signal or image
processing is recommended. Take a look at the course [logistics](logistics/) page
for details.
